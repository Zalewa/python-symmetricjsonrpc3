Conventions
===========

The conventions apply only after the point of forking from the original
repository.

This project adheres to:

- PEP 8 Style Guide
- Conventional Commits 1.0.0 (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- PyPA version scheme (https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/)

Git tags are prefixed with 'v'.

The package's version is automatically deduced from the git tag in the
"no-guess-dev" mode.
